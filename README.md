# path

A maze of twisty little ideas (about biodiversity informatics), all alike.

[Journey on](https://mjy.github.io/path/).

# Disclaimer

This project is meant to be a light-hearted, sometimes slightly opinionated poke at all things Biodiversity Informatics. Any reference
to specific technologies, events, concepts, people or ideas (including those that sound awfully autobiographical) is for the purposes of humour only. YRMV.

This is not a website to promote your tools, but rather the concepts behind the tools.

This was originally conceived as the basis for a Biodiversity 101 Talk for BiodiversityNext 2019.

# Acknowledgements

[Jos√© Luis Pereira](https://github.com/jlpereira) build the interactive website.

The initial list of ideas was dumped during a couple hours of self-reflection, many are memes, tropes, etc.  that most certainly did not originate with the original author. We'll be cross-referencing as time goes on.  Feel free to PR with a citation to the source of any point.

# Organization
## Grails
Sensu Monty Python, but with a tinge of reality. Should reflect something presently impossible, but *maybe* not out of realm of question. Not Star Trek, but also not going to get funded by the NSF.

## Levels
Mean very little, items placement per level are not value judgements. Levels don't necessarily reflect a linear path or progression (which is some kind of iterative network).

The may perhaps be thought of as:
* 1-3 : Local awareness
* 4-6 : Regional awareness
* 7-9 : Global awareness
* 10 : Another dimension

# FAQ

* Why don't we create unique identifiers for each record so we can link to our favourites in our favourite social media?
  * The path ebbs and flows, concepts change. You deal with identifiers every day, free yourself and just wander ;).

# Being serious

There are real ways to "level up". Check out and participate in these initiatives:
* [Biodiversity Literacy in Undergraduate Education](https://www.biodiversityliteracy.com/)
* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org )
* [Data Carpentry ](https://datacarpentry.org/)

# Contributing

Please follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

For now, open a [Waypoint issue](https://github.com/mjy/path/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Waypoint&template=new-waypoint.md&title=%5BWaypoint+-+Level+N%5D) or make a PR.

Moving forward, a potential model: 

* Open an issue or PR with a single contribution
* Once that issue or PR gets 5(?) likes from the community it is added to the list.

# License
CC 0, but if you make money off this list you should donate all of it to a Natural History Collection that employs taxonomists and collection managers (and taxonomists who manage collections).
