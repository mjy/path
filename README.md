# path

A maze of twisty little ideas (about biodiversity informatics), all alike.

[Journey on](https://mjy.github.io/path/).

# Disclaimer

This project is meant to be a light-hearted, sometimes slightly opinionated poke at all things Biodiversity Informatics. Any reference
to specific technologies, events, concepts, people or ideas (including those that sound awfully autobiographical) is for the purposes of humour only. YRMV.

This was originally conceived as the basis for a Biodiversity 101 Talk for BiodiversityNext 2019.

The initial list of ideas was dumped during a couple hours of self-reflection, many are memes, tropes, etc.  that most certainly did not originate with the original author. We'll be cross-referencing as time goes on.  Feel free to PR with a citation to the source of any point.

# Organization
## Grails
Sensu Monty Python, but with a tinge of reality. Should reflect something presently impossible, but *maybe* not out of realm of question. Not Star Trek, but also not going to get funded by the NSF.

# Levels
Mean very little, items placement per level are not value judgements. Levels don't necessarily reflect a linear path or progression (which is some kind of iterative network).

The may perhaps be thought of as:
* 1-3 : Local awareness
* 4-6 : Regional awareness
* 7-9 : Global awareness
* 10 : Another dimension

# Being serious

There are real ways to "level up". Check out and participate in these initiatives:

* [Data Carpentry ](https://datacarpentry.org/)
